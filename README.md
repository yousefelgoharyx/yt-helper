# yt-helper(until we find a better name)
It is an extension aims to make it easier for students to navigate through videos by adding chapters or the ability to seek in any position without the need to use the mouse, *yes we believe that takes time*.

# Beta
The extension is currently in beta and it can only seek for the current time, we don't have many features in mind; only the chapters which we will be adding, so if you have any suggestions open an issue and we will work our best to implepment it.
